# Art-Gallery

I developed this Art Gallery from January to April 2019. It currently doens't utilize a CSS-Framework currently to maintain lightwieght design.

Like most websites, it uses HTML and CSS for design structure. I use JavaScript and PHP to manage purchasing and carting. SQL is used to populate data about purchases and paintings.
